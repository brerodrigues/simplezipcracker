# simplezipcracker

A simple class for zip brute force in python3.

I know, there's a lot of better ways to crack a zip, but don't be a douch and let the boy learn how to code and (try to) use git properly ;)

- zipcracker.py
  - The main class. Is where the hard work for crack the zip is done.
  
- crackzip.py
  - A script written in a rush that uses the class zipcracker.

You could use the *protected.zip* and the *names-pt-br.txt* files for testing.
